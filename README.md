# Task Management Api

---

This project is a self learning project to create simple *CRUD* operation with authentication sytem using .NET.
I try my *best* to use DDD on the development process, but I know that this project isn't completely right on the implementation, but at least I try my best.
I also use Entity Framework and PostgreSQL for this project.
